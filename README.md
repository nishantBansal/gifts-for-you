gifts-for-you
=============
Zappos crawler

Introduction:
The program crawls product data from Zappos.
Takes input from the user. The amount(integer) and the number of gifts.
The format for input is <amount,number of gifts>
It then returns top min{total results, k} results for the query.

Note:
The network should be avaiable and the apiKey should also work.
The program is not handling cases when it is not available.
The maximum value of 'k' is set to 5000, although practically a user won't check this many results. This value can be easily changed.
It works on zero error model, that is the gift combinations returned will sum to the input amount.
The output is given in 'output.txt'. It gives the style ID and price of the product chosen.
"json-simple-1.1.1.jar" is also available here only. Download and add the path for it.

**In case the program is giving errors, please do contact me (nishant.646@gmail.com) because it is working for me. :)


That's all. Enjoy shopping at Zappos!!!
